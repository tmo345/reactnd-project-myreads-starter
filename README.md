# React Fundamentals course final assessment project
## Udacity React Nanodegree

The app has two main views, a main page with the user's library of books represented in bookshelves and a search page where the user can search for new books to add to the library on the main page. Users can move books between shelves on the main page and add new books to their shelves from the search page.
